  This is a makefile intended for compiling any
C/C++ project.  It will find all source files,
compile them appropriately into executables and
libraries, and track all dependencies.

  The makefile itself should not need to be
modified.  A "default.inc" file has been generated,
which contains many options for customizing the
behavior of the makefile for your particular
project.  The initial behavior assumes that most source
files are located in src, include files are
located in include, and source files containing
"int main()" are in the main directory.

  Additional description of the behavior of the
makefile can be found in "default.inc"
